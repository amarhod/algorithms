### Polynomial __add__ method manual instrumentation

This branch only shows how the manual branch coverage testing was performed on the file in algorithms/maths/polynomial.py .

It also adds some print statements to tests/test_polynomial.py to seperate the branch printouts as recursion can give multiple arrays for one test case.
